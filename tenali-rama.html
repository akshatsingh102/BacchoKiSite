                    <h3>🎯 The Story of the Two Thieves</h3>
                    <div class="story-content-large">
                        <p>One day, two thieves were caught stealing from the palace. The king was very angry and wanted to punish them severely. But Tenali Rama had a better idea.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Your Majesty," said Tenali Rama, "Instead of punishing them, let's give them a chance to prove they can be honest. Let's give them each a bag of gold coins and see what they do with it."</p>
                        
                        <p>The king agreed. He gave each thief a bag of 100 gold coins and told them to return in one month.</p>
                        
                        <p>After one month, the first thief came back with 150 gold coins. "I used the money to start a business and earned 50 more coins," he said proudly.</p>
                        
                        <p>The second thief came back with only 50 gold coins. "I'm sorry, Your Majesty," he said sadly. "I lost 50 coins in my business."</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama smiled and said, "Your Majesty, the first thief is still a thief because he stole the idea of starting a business from others. But the second thief is honest because he told the truth about his loss."</p>
                        
                        <p>The king was impressed and gave the second thief a job in the palace, while the first thief was asked to return the extra coins.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>What we learn:</strong> Honesty is always better than cleverness, and telling the truth is more important than making money!</p>

                    <div class="story-content-large">
                        <p>One day, a greedy merchant came to the court and complained to the king. "Your Majesty, someone has stolen my pot of honey. I want justice!"</p>
                        
                        <p>The king asked Tenali Rama to solve this case. Tenali Rama looked at the merchant and said, "Tell me, what was special about your honey pot?"</p>
                        
                        <p>"It was the sweetest honey in the world," said the merchant proudly. "It was so sweet that even ants would come from miles away to taste it."</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama smiled and said, "Then let's find the thief using your honey!" He asked the king to announce that anyone who had a honey pot should bring it to the court the next day.</p>
                        
                        <p>The next day, many people came with their honey pots. Tenali Rama asked each person to taste their honey and tell him how sweet it was.</p>
                        
                        <p>When it was the merchant's turn, he tasted his honey and said, "This is the sweetest honey in the world!"</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama laughed and said, "Your Majesty, this man is the thief! He stole his own honey pot and then came to complain about it to get attention and sympathy."</p>
                        
                        <p>The merchant was embarrassed and admitted his mistake. The king was amused by Tenali Rama's cleverness.</p>

                    <h3>🎨 The Story of the Missing Painting</h3>
                    <div class="story-content-large">
                        <p>One day, the king's favorite painting disappeared from the palace. The king was very upset and asked Tenali Rama to find the thief.</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama looked around the room where the painting was kept and noticed something strange. "Your Majesty," he said, "I can see that the painting was not stolen by a thief, but by someone who wanted to teach us a lesson."</p>
                        
                        <p>The king was confused. "What do you mean, Tenali Rama?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama pointed to the wall where the painting used to hang. "Look at the dust marks on the wall. They show that the painting was taken down very carefully, not torn or damaged. A thief would have been in a hurry and would have left marks of struggle."</p>
                        
                        <p>He continued, "Also, I notice that the painting was of a beautiful garden, but the frame is still here. This means someone took only the painting, not the valuable frame. A thief would have taken the whole thing."</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama then asked all the palace servants to gather in the garden. He told them, "The person who took the painting is here among us. I want you all to look at the garden and tell me what you see."</p>
                        
                        <p>Most people said they saw flowers, trees, and birds. But one gardener said, "I see the same beautiful garden that was in the painting!"</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama smiled and said, "You are the one who took the painting! You loved the garden in the painting so much that you wanted to compare it with the real garden. You didn't steal it to sell it, but because you appreciated its beauty."</p>
                        
                        <p>The gardener admitted that he had taken the painting to study it and learn how to make the palace garden even more beautiful. The king was so impressed that he made the gardener the head gardener and asked him to create a garden as beautiful as the painting.</p>

                    <h3>💰 The Story of the Greedy Minister</h3>
                    <div class="story-content-large">
                        <p>There was a minister in the king's court who was very greedy. He would always try to get more money and gifts from the king. The king was getting tired of his greediness.</p>
                        
                        <p>One day, the king asked Tenali Rama to teach the greedy minister a lesson. Tenali Rama had a clever plan.</p>
                        
                        <p>The next day, Tenali Rama came to the court with a beautiful golden box. "Your Majesty," he said, "I have found a magical box that can give unlimited gold coins. But there's a condition - only a truly generous person can use it."</p>
                        
                        <p>The greedy minister's eyes lit up. "Your Majesty, I am the most generous person in the kingdom! Let me try the magical box!"</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama smiled and said, "Very well, but first you must prove your generosity. Give away all your wealth to the poor people of the kingdom."</p>
                        
                        <p>The minister was shocked. "But... but that's all my money!"</p>
                        
                        <p>Tenali Rama said, "A truly generous person would not hesitate to help others. If you are really generous, you will give away your wealth, and then the magical box will give you unlimited gold."</p>
                        
                        <p>The minister thought about it. If he gave away his money and got unlimited gold, he would be much richer! So he agreed and gave away all his wealth to the poor.</p>
                        
                        <p>After he had given away everything, Tenali Rama opened the golden box. Inside was a note that said, "The real magic is in helping others. You have already received the greatest reward - the happiness of helping people in need."</p>
                        
                        <p>The minister realized his mistake. He had been so focused on getting more money that he had forgotten the joy of helping others. From that day on, he became a truly generous person.</p>

                        <p>One day, a fake sage came to the kingdom claiming he could perform miracles. He said he could make it rain, cure diseases, and even bring back the dead. Many people believed him and gave him money and gifts.</p>
